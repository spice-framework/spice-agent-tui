# Security policy

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories for this
repository. Do not open a public issue containing exploit details, credentials,
prompts, transcripts, or user data.

The terminal client treats all semantic, daemon, and model output as untrusted
text. Public `Text` and prompt constructors reject invalid UTF-8 and terminal
control characters, including escape sequences. View, activity, prompt, terminal
size, and rendered-frame limits bound memory and rendering work. Rendered content
must never be executed, interpolated into a shell, or persisted without an
explicit user-owned destination. Authentication material must be instance-owned,
redacted, and excluded from logs and crash reports.

The shell accepts its context, input, output, model, renderer, and theme from its
caller. It performs no network access, module download, daemon discovery, process
launch, filesystem persistence, or global registration. Cancellation terminates
the Bubble Tea program and is returned to the caller.

Product dependencies are pinned and vendored; their review is recorded in
`docs/dependency-review.md`. Build tools are independently pinned in
`tools/go.mod`, execute only during local verification, and receive the same
vulnerability and checksum review as product dependencies.

The annotation executable is a trusted native Go tool, not a sandbox. A
consuming application's root `go.mod` must authorize its fully qualified package
path, and standard Go module versions, checksums, vendor state, and replacements
remain visible. The tool never downloads dependencies, scans packages, executes
annotated factories, or writes generated files. It accepts only framed v1alpha2
stdio requests, validates exact descriptor/tool identities, bounds work through
caller cancellation, writes protocol frames exclusively to stdout, and reports
process diagnostics to stderr. Its handlers return generic compiler metadata;
they do not perform string-based type matching or runtime reflection.

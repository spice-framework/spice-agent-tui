# Spice Agent TUI

Unified documentation: [spiceframework.dev/agent/interfaces/tui](https://spiceframework.dev/agent/interfaces/tui/).

This repository owns the terminal experience for Spice Agent. Its public API is
UI-neutral; Bubble Tea v2 is confined to `internal/presentation` and is reached
through the `terminal` facade.

The implemented slice includes:

- bounded immutable text, workspace, status, prompt, theme, frame, command,
  intent, session snapshot, and tagged session-update values;
- a `Session` seam with only `Receive(context.Context)` and
  `Perform(context.Context, Intent)`;
- deterministic fixed-size light/dark rendering and accessible line-oriented
  rendering;
- grapheme-safe editing, injected ordered key bindings, bounded history and
  activity, monotonic revision handling, and stale-update rejection;
- cancellation-aware Bubble Tea lifecycle and panic-contained one-shot session
  effects;
- a public-facade interaction proof that drives real Bubble Tea input through
  prompt submission, concurrent run cancellation, and clean Ctrl-Q shutdown;
- public `terminal.NewFixedRenderer` and `terminal.NewShell` factories whose
  signatures expose no Bubble Tea or internal types;
- canonical `@UIShell` and `@UIRenderer` provider annotations; and
- explicit `/autoconfigure` fallback beans proven by committed generated Go.

## Session boundary

An application injects an implementation of:

```go
type Session interface {
    Receive(context.Context) (SessionUpdate, error)
    Perform(context.Context, Intent) (CommandResult, error)
}
```

`Receive` owns one strictly increasing positive revision sequence. Updates are a
closed tagged union of complete snapshots, activity items, and prompt-history
replacements. Constructors validate all text and aggregate bounds and clone
caller-owned slices. A non-monotonic value stops the receive loop with a safe
visible error rather than spinning on a broken stream. Presentation invokes
each session operation exactly once: it does not reconnect, replay, or retry. A
transport client owns those policies. Implementations must be concurrency-safe
for one blocking receive, one ordinary operation, and one cancel-run operation;
the shell serializes calls within each lane.
Panics become the fixed error `session operation panicked`; panic values cannot
reach the terminal. Cancellation causes remain observable with `errors.Is`, but
a valid result or explicit error returned by the Session wins a concurrent late
cancellation so committed work is not misreported.
A `CommandResult` returned from `Perform` may not contain another intent.

## Direct composition

```go
renderer := terminal.NewFixedRenderer()
bindings, err := agenttui.StandardKeyBindings()
shell, err := terminal.NewShell(
    session,
    renderer,
    agenttui.DarkTheme(),
    bindings,
    initialView,
    streams,
    agenttui.NewTerminalConfig(accessible),
)
```

`TerminalConfig` is presentation-only and currently selects accessible mode.
Definition selection, revision selection, reconnect, and graceful daemon
shutdown belong to the future distribution/client runner. The constructor
snapshots the injected `Theme` SPI and key bindings, so later mutable provider
state cannot alter the running shell.

## Spice auto-configuration

Applications opt in explicitly:

```go
import _ "github.com/spice-framework/spice-agent-tui/autoconfigure"
```

The package contributes fallback beans for the fixed renderer, dark `Theme`,
eleven standard ordered `KeyBinding` values, connecting initial `ViewData`, OS
terminal streams, normal `TerminalConfig`, and the terminal `Shell`. It never
creates a fake session or a client configuration. Without an application-owned
exact `agenttui.Session` bean, the shell fallback remains inactive.

Key bindings are individual named collection elements because Spice collection
injection is `[]KeyBinding`, not an opaque slice provider. This preserves exact
generated order and gives embedding/tests typed per-bean overrides. Current
source-level collection selection does not back off fallback elements by bean
name; an application that needs a different binding set supplies its own Shell.
Duplicate actions and keystrokes fail during shell construction.

The committed `internal/spicegen/compositionproof` target is generated from an
external-package acceptance fixture. It proves direct construction, collection
order, exact Session injection, fallback activation, source mapping, generated
freshness, compilation, explicit `NewApplication` → `Start` → `Shell.Run` →
`Stop` normal exit, and shutdown without reflection or a runtime registry.

## Annotations

Applications may define explicit providers with the TUI annotation tool:

```go
// @import { UIShell, UIRenderer } from "github.com/spice-framework/spice-agent-tui/annotation/ui"

// @UIShell(name="terminal", primary=true)
func NewApplicationShell(...) agenttui.Shell

// @UIRenderer(name="fixed", fallback=true)
func NewApplicationRenderer(...) agenttui.Renderer
```

The handlers consume shared compiler result facts and require the exact public
interface identity while preserving Go aliases. They never execute providers,
parse type-name strings, or add TUI behavior to the compiler. See
[`docs/annotations.md`](docs/annotations.md).

This repository still does not own a daemon, gRPC, operating-system IPC,
managed-daemon discovery, or a terminal executable. Those arrive through an
adopted high-level client and the distribution repository.

Go 1.26.5 is exact. Run `make tools-bootstrap` once on a fresh clone, `make
fast` for affected feedback, `make check` for the broad edit loop, and `make
verify` before a commit. Ordinary verification is offline.

## Release contract

`spice-release.json` is inert, canonical metadata for the centrally authorized
`go-module-v1` release profile. `make verify-release` runs the repository's
complete local gate. The organization release authority independently binds
the repository name, module path, exact preview version, required module graph,
commit, and tag before it creates any artifact or release.
